CMakeLists.txt:
1. make flex/bison compatable with C++11
2. clean up flex/bison generated files (rm parser/*pp)
3. after changes in tokens.l, tokens.cpp are not regenerated

AST (node.h)
1. remove LLVM deps
2. add check that function was not defined previously

Language:
1. Could we have nested function declarations?
2. Could we have functions with same names?
3. Could we use function before its declaration? (if not, it is close to C++).
